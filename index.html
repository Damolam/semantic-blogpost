			<p class="font-style2"> <em>Every great journey begins with a single step, and mine started with a curious glance at the HTML code behind my favorite websites. What started as a mere interest quickly transformed into a passionate pursuit. In this blog post, I’ll share the milestones of my HTML programming journey, the challenges I faced, and the triumphs that fueled my passion for web development.</em></p>
            <h4><em class="font-style">DISCOVERING HTML</em></h4>
            <p class="font-style2"><em>The spark of interest:<br>My journey began in high school when I stumbled upon a web development tutorial on YouTube. The idea of creating something from scratch using just code fascinated me. I quickly learned that HTML was the foundation of the web, and I wanted to learn how to build my own pages.</p>
            	<h5 class="font-style">LEARNING THE BASICS:TAGS AND STRUCTURES</h5>
            	<p class="font-style2"><em>At first, I focused on understanding the fundamental building blocks of HTML. I learned about tags, elements, and attributes. My initial projects were basic—simple pages with headings, paragraphs, images, and links. I remember feeling a rush of excitement when I saw my first webpage render in the browser. It was exhilarating to see my code come to life, even in its simplest form!</em></p>
